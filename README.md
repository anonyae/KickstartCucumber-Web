Feel free to fork to kickstart a Cucumber BDD framework for web testing.

For API and database testing I will be adding a new kickstarter with cool utilities. 

###Framework:
Tools: Java 11, Maven, Selenium, WebDriverManager by bonigarcia, Cucumber-java, Cucumber-junit
Design patterns: Page Object Model, Singleton Driver

Any recommendations are welcome.
